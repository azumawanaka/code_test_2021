    > Ensuring our code to be clean and free of bugs. Not all the time our codes is good enough after passing some tests. To ensure good quality and
      maintainable, we as a programmer should invest more time in doing some refactoring, refactoring and refactoring. If our code is not clean, then it is hard
      to maintain even though we are the one whos writing it long ago but a time will come that we have to look back to our code and we found it is really messed up due to
      lack of consistency and quality. What I did is first write it, test it, refactor and then vise-versa until we can produce the best quality and removing out all unused parts.
      
My Thoughts about the code
   > The codes is a total chaos in my own observation. Mostly every method has many things to do instead focus on 1 thing/method. And instead of giving its parameter type directly, it was implemented inside doc blocks. Removing also extra line-breaks which is not advisable as per PSR-12: Extended Coding Style - https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/. Most of the codes needs to refactor/cleaning.
